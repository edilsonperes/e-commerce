## Getting started

- Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.
- Install all dependencies by running `npm install` from the root folder.

## Configuring environment variables

On the root folder, create a `.env` file just like the file `.env.example`. This file will store environment variables like the server port and the mongo connection URI.
